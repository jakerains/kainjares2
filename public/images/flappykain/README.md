# Flappy Kain Game Artwork Requirements

This directory should contain the following images for the Flappy Kain easter egg game:

## Required Images

1. **ufo.png**
   - A UFO-shaped spacecraft with Kain as the pilot
   - Recommended size: 100x100 pixels
   - PNG format with transparent background
   - This will be the main game character that the player controls

2. **pipe.png**
   - A vertical pipe/obstacle with a space theme (like a laser barrier or alien structure)
   - Recommended size: 80x400 pixels (will be scaled in-game)
   - PNG format with transparent background
   - This will be used for both top and bottom obstacles (the bottom one gets flipped)

3. **space-bg.png**
   - A seamless space background with stars, nebulae, or other cosmic elements
   - Recommended size: 800x600 pixels
   - Should be designed to look good when scrolling horizontally

## Design Notes
- Use a consistent space theme with bright, vibrant colors
- The obstacles (pipes) should stand out against the background
- The UFO should be recognizable and fun
- Consider adding a slight glow effect to objects to enhance the space theme
